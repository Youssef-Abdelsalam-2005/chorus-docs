## Create Your First Agent

Welcome to Chorus! This guide will help you create your first AI agent and make a test call in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. A Chorus account ([sign up here](https://app.chorus-ai.co))
2. An API key (generate one in your dashboard under Settings > API Keys)

## Step 1: Create an Agent

Create your first agent using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Agent",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a friendly AI assistant. Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.",
    "isActive": true,
    "allowEndCall": true,
    "firstSpeaker": "agent",
    "agentGreeting": "Hello! This is your AI assistant calling. How can I help you today?",
    "agentGreetingEnabled": true
  }'
```

Save the `id` from the response - you'll need it for making calls.

## Step 2: Add a Phone Number

If you want to make real calls, add a phone number. For Twilio:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/phone-numbers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Twilio Number",
    "number": "+15551234567",
    "provider": "twilio",
    "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "twilioAccountSid": "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "twilioAuthToken": "your-auth-token"
  }'
```

Make an actual phone call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-organization-id: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "phoneNumberId": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_ID",
    "to": "+15559876543"
  }'
```

Your agent will call the specified number!

## Step 3: Check Call Details

After the call completes, retrieve the details:

```bash
curl https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/calls/CALL_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You'll see:
- Call duration
- Transcript
- Recording URL
- Call status

## What's Next?

### Customize Your Agent

Make your agent more sophisticated:

```json
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are a customer support agent for Acme Inc. Your goal is to help customers with their questions about our products and services. Be friendly, professional, and concise.\n\nKey Information:\n- Business hours: Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM EST\n- Return policy: 30 days with receipt\n- Support email: support@acme.com\n\nAlways:\n1. Greet the customer warmly\n2. Ask clarifying questions\n3. Provide clear, accurate information\n4. Offer to help with anything else\n5. Thank them for calling",
  "allowEndCall": true,
  "maxCallDurationSeconds": 600
}
```

### Add Custom Tools

Give your agent superpowers by connecting it to your APIs:

```json
{
  "name": "check_order_status",
  "description": "Check the status of a customer's order using their order ID",
  "type": "http",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://api.your-company.com/orders/status",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    ],
    "body": [
      {
        "name": "order_id",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The customer's order ID",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Learn more in the [Tools documentation](/docs/core-concepts/tools).

### Use Context Variables

Personalize conversations with dynamic data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-organization-id: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "phoneNumberId": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_ID",
    "to": "+15559876543",
    "contextVariables": {
      "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
      "order_id": "12345",
      "order_status": "Shipped",
      "tracking_number": "1Z999AA1234567890"
    }
  }'
```

Update your system prompt to use these variables:

```
You are calling {{customer_name}} about order #{{order_id}}.

Order Status: {{order_status}}
Tracking: {{tracking_number}}

Ask if they have any questions about their delivery.
```

Learn more in the [Context Variables guide](/docs/guides/context-variables).

### Set Up Webhooks

Get notified when calls complete:

```json
{
  "postCallWebhookUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/call-completed",
  "postCallWebhookSecret": "your-secret-key"
}
```

You'll receive a POST request with:
- Call transcript
- Duration and status
- Recording URL
- Extracted data

Learn more in the [Webhooks guide](/docs/guides/webhooks).

### Extract Structured Data

Configure your agent to extract specific information:

```json
{
  "postCallExtractionSchema": [
    {
      "name": "customer_satisfied",
      "description": "Was the customer satisfied with the resolution?",
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "issue_type",
      "description": "What type of issue did the customer have?",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "follow_up_needed",
      "description": "Does this require a follow-up?",
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted data appears in call details and webhook payloads.

## Common Use Cases
