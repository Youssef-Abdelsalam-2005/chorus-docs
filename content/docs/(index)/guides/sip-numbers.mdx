## Overview

Chorus supports SIP trunking, giving you two connection modes: **IP Allowlist** and **Registration**. Choose the mode that fits your PBX/SBC setup.

## IP Allowlist Mode

Use IP allowlisting when your PBX has a static IP address and you want a simple, credential-free connection.

### Step 1: Configure Your SIP Trunk

On your PBX/SBC, configure a SIP trunk pointing to our SIP server for your region.

### Step 2: Allowlist our SIP sever's IPs

Allowlist our SIP server's IP addresses on your PBX. This allows our SIP server to send SIP INVITEs to your PBX.

### Step 3: Add the Number in Chorus

In your Chorus dashboard, add the number with mode **IP Allowlist** and enter:

- **Phone number** — your number in E.164 format (e.g. `+15551234567`)
- **PBX IP address** — the public IP of your PBX/SBC
- **Port** — the SIP port (default `5060`)

The platform automatically creates a SIP trunk on our SIP server with your IP allowlisted and registers the number for inbound webhooks. No further configuration is needed.

## SIP Registration Mode

Use registration mode when your PBX expects SIP clients to register with credentials (username/password).

### Step 1: Create a SIP Account

On your PBX/SBC, create a SIP account or extension that accepts registrations.

### Step 2: Add the Number in Chorus

In your Chorus dashboard, add the number with mode **Registration** and enter:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phone number | Yes | Your number in E.164 format |
| Username | Yes | The SIP username to register with |
| Password | Yes | The SIP password |
| Host | Yes | Your PBX hostname or IP (the SIP realm/registrar) |
| Port | No | SIP port (default `5060`) |
| Outbound Proxy | No | Proxy address if SIP traffic needs to route through a proxy instead of directly to the host |
| Auth User | No | Digest auth username, if it differs from the SIP username |

Our SIP server will actively register (`SIP REGISTER`) to your PBX using the provided credentials. Once registered, inbound and outbound calls flow through the trunk automatically.
