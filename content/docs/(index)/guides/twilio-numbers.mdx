## Overview

This guide walks you through connecting a Twilio phone number to Chorus so your agents can make and receive calls.

## Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://console.twilio.com) with a purchased phone number
- Your Twilio **Account SID** and **Auth Token** (found in the Twilio console dashboard)
- A Chorus account with API access

## Step 1: Buy a Phone Number

Purchase a phone number from the [Twilio console](https://console.twilio.com). Choose a number with voice capabilities in your desired region.

## Step 2: Configure the Voice Webhook

In the Twilio console, navigate to your phone number's configuration and set the **Voice webhook URL** to:

```
https://<your-api-domain>/twilio/answer
```

- **Method**: `POST`

This tells Twilio to forward incoming calls to Chorus for handling.

## Step 3: Add the Number in Chorus

In your Chorus dashboard, add the number with the **Twilio** provider. You'll need to enter:

- **Phone number** — the Twilio number you purchased (E.164 format, e.g. `+15551234567`)
- **Account SID** — your Twilio Account SID (starts with `AC`)
- **Auth Token** — your Twilio Auth Token

You can also add the number via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chorus-ai.co/v1/phone-numbers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Twilio Number",
    "number": "+15551234567",
    "provider": "twilio",
    "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "twilioAccountSid": "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "twilioAuthToken": "your-auth-token"
  }'
```

Once configured, your agent can receive inbound calls on this number and make outbound calls through it.
