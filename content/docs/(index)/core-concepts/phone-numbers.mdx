## Introduction

Phone numbers are the bridge between your agents and the phone network. Chorus supports multiple telephony providers, allowing you to use your existing numbers or provision new ones.

## Supported Providers

Chorus integrates with the following telephony providers:

- **Twilio**: Industry-leading cloud communications platform
- **SIP**: Standard SIP trunking for enterprise deployments

## Provider Comparison

| Feature | Twilio | SIP |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Global Coverage | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Depends on trunk |
| Setup Complexity | ⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐ Moderate |
| Use Case | Quick setup | Enterprise |

## Adding a Phone Number

### Twilio

To add a Twilio phone number:

1. Purchase or identify a phone number in your Twilio account
2. Get your Twilio credentials:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
3. Add the number via API or dashboard

```json
{
  "name": "Support Line",
  "number": "+15551234567",
  "provider": "twilio",
  "agentId": "agent-uuid",
  "twilioAccountSid": "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "twilioAuthToken": "your-auth-token"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
Credentials are encrypted and stored securely. Your Auth Token is never exposed in API responses.
</Callout>

### SIP

For SIP trunk configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "Enterprise Trunk",
  "number": "+15551234567",
  "provider": "sip",
  "agentId": "agent-uuid",
  "sipUsername": "your-username",
  "sipPassword": "your-password",
  "sipProxy": "sip.your-provider.com",
  "sipOutboundProxy": "outbound.your-provider.com",
  "sipAuthUser": "auth-username"
}
```

Required fields for SIP:
- `sipUsername`: SIP authentication username
- `sipPassword`: SIP authentication password  
- `sipProxy`: SIP server address

Optional fields:
- `sipOutboundProxy`: Separate outbound proxy if needed
- `sipAuthUser`: Alternative auth username

## Assigning Agents

Each phone number can be assigned to a default agent. When an inbound call arrives on that number, it will be handled by the assigned agent.

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent-uuid"
}
```

## Inbound Call Flow

When someone calls your phone number:

1. Call arrives at your telephony provider (Twilio/SIP)
2. Provider sends webhook to Chorus platform
3. Chorus validates the number and organization
4. Platform checks organization balance (if applicable)
5. Assigned agent configuration is loaded
6. WebSocket stream is established with the agent runtime
7. Conversation begins

## Outbound Calls

Use phone numbers to make outbound calls via the API:

```json
POST /api/calls/outbound
{
  "agentId": "agent-uuid",
  "phoneNumberId": "phone-uuid",
  "to": "+15559876543",
  "contextVariables": {
    "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
    "reason": "Follow-up on support ticket #1234"
  }
}
```

The call will be placed from the specified phone number using its configured provider.

## Webhook Configuration

After adding a phone number, you'll need to configure webhooks with your provider:

### Twilio Webhook URLs

Configure these in your Twilio phone number settings:

**Voice URL (Incoming calls):**
```
https://api.chorus-ai.co/twilio/answer
```

**Method:** POST

### SIP Configuration

For Jambonz application settings:

**Call Webhook:**
```
https://api.chorus-ai.co/jambonz/webhook
```

**Call Status Webhook:**
```
https://api.chorus-ai.co/api/jambonz/status
```

## Security

All credentials (Twilio Auth Tokens, SIP passwords) are:
- Encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Never returned in API responses
- Stored securely in the database
- Only decrypted during call initiation

## Testing

Test your phone number configuration:

1. Call your phone number from any phone
2. Verify the agent answers and can converse
3. Check call logs in the dashboard

For outbound testing, use the "Make Test Call" feature in the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Calls Not Connecting

**Check:**
- Webhook URLs are correctly configured in your provider
- Phone number is active in your provider account
- Agent is assigned and active
- Organization has sufficient balance

### One-Way Audio

**Possible causes:**
- NAT/Firewall issues (SIP providers)
- Incorrect SIP proxy configuration
- Network connectivity problems

**Solution:**
- Verify SIP settings
- Check outbound proxy configuration
- Test from different network

### Authentication Errors

**Check:**
- Twilio Account SID and Auth Token are correct
- SIP credentials match your trunk configuration
- Credentials haven't expired or been rotated
