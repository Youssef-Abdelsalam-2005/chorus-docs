## Introduction

Agents are the core of the Chorus platform. An agent is an AI-powered conversational system that can handle phone calls autonomously, responding to customers in natural language and executing actions through custom tools.

## What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is a configurable voice AI assistant that:

- Handles inbound and outbound phone calls
- Follows a system prompt to guide conversations
- Uses speech-to-text, language models, and text-to-speech for natural interactions
- Can call custom HTTP tools to fetch data or trigger actions
- Extracts structured data from conversations
- Sends webhooks with call summaries and results

## Creating an Agent

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | A descriptive name for your agent (e.g., "Support Agent", "Sales Qualifier") |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `systemPrompt` | string | Instructions that guide the agent's behavior (max 32,000 characters) |
| `slmModelId` | UUID | The language model to use for the agent |
| `voiceId` | UUID | The voice to use for speech synthesis |
| `voiceSpeed` | number | Voice speed multiplier (0.6 - 1.5, default: 1.0) |
| `isActive` | boolean | Whether the agent is active and can handle calls |
| `allowEndCall` | boolean | Whether the agent can end calls proactively |
| `firstSpeaker` | enum | Who speaks first: `"user"` or `"agent"` (default: `"user"`) |

| `agentGreetingEnabled` | boolean | Whether to use a custom greeting |
| `maxCallDurationSeconds` | integer | Maximum call duration in seconds (30-3600, default: 600) |
| `voiceStability` | number | Voice stability setting, 0.0-1.0 (ElevenLabs/Faseeh only, default: 0.5) |
| `firstMessageUninterruptible` | boolean | Whether the agent's first message cannot be interrupted |
| `firstMessageDelay` | number | Seconds to wait before the agent sends its first message (default: 0) |

| `backgroundSoundId` | UUID | ID of the background sound to play during calls |
| `backgroundSoundVolume` | number | Volume of the background sound, 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.15) |

## System Prompt

The system prompt is the most important configuration for your agent. It defines the agent's personality, goals, and conversation flow.

### Best Practices

```
You are a friendly customer support agent for Acme Inc. Your goal is to help 
customers resolve their issues quickly and professionally.

Key Guidelines:
- Always greet the customer warmly
- Ask clarifying questions to understand their issue
- Be concise and avoid technical jargon
- If you can't help, offer to transfer to a human agent
- End calls politely and confirm if the issue was resolved

Important Context:
- Company hours: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM EST
- Support email: support@acme.com
- Return policy: 30 days with receipt
```

### Using Context Variables

You can use template variables in your system prompt that get replaced with call-specific data:

```
You are calling {{customer_name}} about their recent order #{{order_id}}.

Order Details:
- Product: {{product_name}}
- Order Date: {{order_date}}
- Shipping Status: {{shipping_status}}

Ask if they have any questions about their order.
```

When creating a call, pass these variables in the `contextVariables` field:

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent-uuid",
  "phoneNumberId": "phone-uuid",
  "to": "+15551234567",
  "contextVariables": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "order_id": "12345",
    "product_name": "Premium Widget",
    "order_date": "2024-01-15",
    "shipping_status": "In Transit"
  }
}
```

## Voice and Model Selection

### Language Models

Choose from available language models optimized for real-time conversations. Different models offer various capabilities:

- Faster response times
- Better multilingual support
- Enhanced reasoning abilities
- Cost optimization

View available models using the `/v1/slm-models` endpoint.

### Voices

Select from a variety of voices to match your brand and use case. Configure:

- **Voice ID**: The specific voice to use
- **Voice Speed**: Adjust speech rate (0.6x to 1.5x)

View available voices using the `/v1/voices` endpoint.

## First Speaker and Greetings

### First Speaker

Control who speaks first on the call:

- **`user`** (default): Agent waits for the person to speak first
- **`agent`**: Agent speaks immediately when the call connects

### Agent Greeting

When `firstSpeaker` is set to `"agent"`, you can configure the greeting:

- **AI-Generated** (`agentGreetingEnabled: false`): Agent generates a contextual greeting
- **Custom Message** (`agentGreetingEnabled: true`): Use your own greeting text

```json
{
  "firstSpeaker": "agent",
  "agentGreeting": "Hi {{customer_name}}, this is calling from Acme Inc. Do you have a moment to talk about your recent inquiry?",
  "agentGreetingEnabled": true
}
```

## Tools

Agents can be configured with custom HTTP tools that allow them to:

- Fetch customer data from your CRM
- Check inventory or order status
- Schedule appointments
- Create support tickets
- Trigger workflows

Learn more in the [Tools documentation](/docs/core-concepts/tools).

## Post-Call Configuration

### Call Summaries

Enable automatic call summarization:

```json
{
  "postCallSummaryEnabled": true
}
```

### Data Extraction

Extract structured data from conversations using a schema:

```json
{
  "postCallExtractionSchema": [
    {
      "name": "customer_interest",
      "description": "What product or service is the customer interested in?",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "follow_up_needed",
      "description": "Does the customer need a follow-up call?",
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "budget",
      "description": "What is the customer's budget range?",
      "type": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Webhooks

Receive POST requests when calls complete:

```json
{
  "postCallWebhookUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/call-completed",
  "postCallWebhookSecret": "your-webhook-secret"
}
```

The webhook payload includes:
- Call duration and status
- Transcript and recording URLs
- AI-generated summary
- Extracted data fields

Learn more in the [Webhooks guide](/docs/guides/webhooks).

## Agent Transfer

Agents can transfer calls to other agents during a conversation. Configure transfer targets to enable seamless handoffs between specialized agents.

For example:
- Transfer from a general support agent to a technical specialist
- Route sales calls to specific account managers
- Escalate to supervisors when needed

## Advanced Turn-Taking Settings

Fine-tune how the agent detects when a user has finished speaking and manages interruptions:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `turnEndpointDelay` | integer | Silence duration in ms before the agent responds (50-2000, default: 100) |
| `minTurnDuration` | integer | Minimum speech duration in ms to count as a valid turn (0-2000, default: 50) |
| `minInterruptionDuration` | integer | How long in ms the user must speak to interrupt the agent (0-2000, default: 100) |
| `frameActivationThreshold` | number | VAD probability threshold for speech detection (0.0-1.0, default: 0.35) |
| `postSpeechCooldown` | integer | Echo guard timeout in ms after agent stops speaking (0-5000, default: 400) |
| `ultravadEotThreshold` | number | End-of-turn probability threshold (0.0-1.0, default: 0.1) |
| `speculativeSilenceMs` | integer | How quickly in ms to start speculative inference on silence (0-5000, default: 150) |
| `fallbackSilenceMs` | integer | Fallback timeout in ms if endpointing fails (0-10000, default: 3000) |

These settings have sensible defaults and most agents won't need to change them. Adjust only if you need to fine-tune latency or turn-taking behavior.

## Call Duration Limits

Set maximum call duration to manage costs and prevent excessive calls:

```json
{
  "maxCallDurationSeconds": 1800  // 30 minutes
}
```

Calls automatically end when this limit is reached.

## Example: Complete Agent Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Customer Support Agent",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful support agent for Acme Inc...",
  "slmModelId": "model-uuid",
  "voiceId": "voice-uuid",
  "voiceSpeed": 1.0,
  "isActive": true,
  "allowEndCall": true,
  "firstSpeaker": "agent",
  "agentGreeting": "Hi, this is Alex from Acme support. How can I help you today?",
  "agentGreetingEnabled": true,
  "maxCallDurationSeconds": 600,
  "postCallSummaryEnabled": true,
  "postCallExtractionSchema": [
    {
      "name": "issue_resolved",
      "description": "Was the customer's issue resolved?",
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  ],
  "postCallWebhookUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhook"
}
```
